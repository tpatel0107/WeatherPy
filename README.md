# WeatherPy
In order to plan a more detailed trip we are adding weather description to the weather data and asking beta testers to use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which we can use to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list that we create of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to creat a travel itinerary. We used google maps API to map directions and create a travel route between the four cities and create a marker layer map.
